System Modeling :
The first step in the control design process is to develop appropriate mathematical models of the 
system to be controlled. These models may be derived either from physical laws or experimental 
data. This section introduces the state-space and transfer function representations of dynamic 
systems. We then review some basic approaches to modeling mechanical and electrical systems 
and show how to generate these models in MATLAB for further analysis. 
Key MATLAB commands used in this tutorial are: ss, tf
